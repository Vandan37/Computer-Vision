Implementing the following algorithms for image feature matching.
- Harris Corner Detection for keypoint identification
- Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression (ANMS) for avoiding key-point detection in high contrast regions.
- Feature Description using e Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) 
- Feature Matching using Nearest Neighbor search algorithm
